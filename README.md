# HERB

HERB (Handy Emergency Rescue Bot) was built to access and provide aid in situations where it is too
dangerous for emergency personnel to enter. It is a small robot that can be controlled remotely (through
an ssh connection with the QNX software) It was built using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, python, and QNX, two 
5 volt motors and various smaller components. The robot is a proof of concept for a larger version. We made 
["breakthrough after breakthrough"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7287173212080164865/) 
and ended up securing a 3rd place finish at the uOttaHack 7 hackathon!
